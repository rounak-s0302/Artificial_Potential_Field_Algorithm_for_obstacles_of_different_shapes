# Artificial_Potential_Field_Algorithm_for_obstacles_of_different_shapes
The Artificial Potential field is a path planning algorithm for moving the robot from the initial to the goal point
by the artificial potential field method found by Khatib. The idea is very simple, the robot is assumed to have positive
charge and the goal to be negatively charged and all other obstacles are also assumed to have positive charge, so that 
the robot will attract towards the goal and repulse from the obstacles using suitable field functions based on distance 
between all three . By picking suitable field functions , we can optimize our robot’s speed , minimize the number of turns
it has to take , etc. 

## How the robot is deciding its path….?
It uses a potential function to determine the overall field generated by obstacles and the goal both on the
position of the robot using potential field functions based on distance. The robot moves to a lower energy 
configuration(goal is at zero potential , that’s why..), energy is minimized by following the negative gradient
of the potential energy function At every point of time , the robot looks at the vector at the point and goes in
that direction.
